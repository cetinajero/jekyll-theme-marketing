# Contributing to the Jekyll theme marketing gem

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to the Jekyll theme marketing gem. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

The Jekyll theme marketing gem is an open source project. We'd love for you to get involved. Whatever your level of skill or however much time you can give, your contribution is greatly appreciated. There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, helping other users by commenting on issues, or writing code which can be incorporated into the Jekyll theme marketing gem itself.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## How to report a bug

Think you found a bug? Please check [the list of open issues](https://github.com/cetinajero/jekyll-theme-marketing/issues) to see if your bug has already been reported. If it hasn't please [submit a new issue](https://github.com/cetinajero/jekyll-theme-marketing/issues/new).

Here are a few tips for writing *great* bug reports:

* Complete the template provided on the new issue form
* Describe the specific problem (e.g., "widget doesn't turn clockwise" versus "getting an error")
* Include the steps to reproduce the bug, what you expected to happen, and what happened instead
* Check that you are using the latest version of the project and its dependencies
* Include what version of the project your using, as well as any relevant dependencies
* Only include one bug per issue. If you have discovered two bugs, please file two issues
* Even if you don't know how to fix the bug, including a failing test may help others track it down

* Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bug fix
* Don't bump the version number in your pull request (it will be bumped prior to release)
* Write [a good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
